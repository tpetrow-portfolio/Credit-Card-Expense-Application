## Analysis
### 1. Project Topic and Description:
  #### 	Project Topic: 
      • Credit Card Expense Management
  #### 	Description: 
    The application processes credit card expense reports from 100 employees over 20 annual work trips spanning the last 5 
    fiscal years. It focuses on organizing and analyzing expenditure data to aid in budget formulation and detect trends and anomalies.
### 2. Project Purpose and Goals:
  #### 	Purpose: 
      • To enhance financial planning and management by analyzing company credit card expenditures.
  #### 	Goals:
      • Collect and systematically organize expense data.
      • Identify and analyze spending trends and anomalies.
      • Provide actionable insights for future budget planning and financial oversight.
### 3. Descriptive Method:
  #### 	Charts and Graphs: 
      • Visualizations to show spending patterns by category, trends over time, and deviations from budget.
  #### 	Tables: 
      • Detailed tables to display average spending, total expenses by category, and individual trip expenditures.
  #### 	Insights: 
      • Highlight average spending, detect over-budget categories, and identify under-utilized funds.
### 4. Predictive or Prescriptive Method:
  #### 	Graphs and Charts: 
      • Visualize spending trends with best-fit lines to assist in future budget planning.
  #### 	Forecasting: 
      • Predict future budget-planning based on historical spending data.
  #### 	Clustering Algorithm: 
      • Apply DBSCAN clustering to categorize spending patterns and identify anomalies.
